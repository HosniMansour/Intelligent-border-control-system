This project is about setting up an intelligent border control system based on machine learning and deep learning. This solution will help reduce the workload of human agents, reduce the time the traveler has to spend at the border and increase the eï¬ƒciency and security of border crossing.

To make this project we developed separate modules which are face matching, passport data extraction, and traveler abnormal behavior.
